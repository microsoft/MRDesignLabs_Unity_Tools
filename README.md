# Mixed Reality Design Labs
This repo is where Microsoft's Windows Mixed Reality Design team publishes the Unity tools we use in examples and explorations. These set of tools have been separated into this repo for easy inclusion in you project or repo.  This tools repository is now used as a submodule throughout our MRDesignLabs examples.

# Including as a SubModule
The simplest way to add the tools to your project is via a submodule.  This will create and internal link within your repo to the *MRDesignLab* set of tools.  To do this simple navigate to your Assets folder in your project and use "git submodule add https://github.com/Microsoft/MRDesignLabs_Unity_Tools.git ./MRDesignLab" to create the submodule for Mixed Reality Design Labs Unity tools.
